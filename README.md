# Klaus - Multipurpose Bot
This is a Discord bot designed in Python using the [discord.py] library. It is intended for use in smaller servers and to be selfhosted by the owners/admins, if you are looking for alternatives to lots of the features locked behind 'Premium' on other bots.

The bot contains all basic moderation features, announcements, automoderator, levelling, polling, automessages and a music feature (WIP)

# Installation
### Prerequisites
1) Look in **requirements.txt** for the required packages and links to them on GitHub. Install these via command line.
2) Have a bot made in the Discord developer portal, with an OAUTH link to your server with admin permissions. Guides for this can be found online.
3) Developer mode enabled on Discord to gather ID's of channels

### Using the bot
1) Next, download the latest release source code and edit the values in **config.json** for your particular guild.
2) Run **discordbot.py** to start the bot and it should connect to the server, no other Python config needed.
3) Enjoy the use of the bot and feel free to raise any issues in GitHub.
